# Mindfulness Project

A console-based C# application designed to help users practice mindfulness techniques such as breathing, reflecting, and listing.  
The program guides users through interactive activities, tracks their session time, and provides meaningful feedback to encourage relaxation and self-awareness.

---

## Features
- **Breathing Activity**: Guides the user through timed breathing exercises for relaxation.  
- **Reflection Activity**: Prompts the user with thought-provoking questions to encourage deeper reflection.  
- **Listing Activity**: Encourages users to list out positive things (gratitude, strengths, etc.) within a time frame.  
- **Activity Timer**: Tracks the duration of each session.  
- **User-Friendly Prompts**: Clear, simple instructions to guide users.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand and apply **object-oriented programming** principles in C#.  
- Practice **class inheritance and polymorphism** by creating different activity types derived from a base class.  
- Develop skills in **structuring console applications** with clean, modular design.  
- Implement **loops, conditionals, and timers** for interactive user experiences.  
- Improve **user interaction and feedback handling** through meaningful console messages.

## Concepts Practiced
- **Inheritance & Polymorphism**: Creating a base `Activity` class with shared functionality, then extending it with specialized activities.  
- **Encapsulation**: Grouping related methods and properties within classes for cleaner code.  
- **Abstraction**: Hiding implementation details while exposing only essential activity behaviors.  
- **Timers and Delays**: Using time-based logic (`Thread.Sleep`, etc.) to pace activities.  
- **Randomization**: Randomly selecting prompts for reflection to ensure varied sessions.  
- **Clean Code Practices**: Code organization, readability, and separation of concerns.
