# C# Programming Projects

This repository contains a collection of C# projects I developed while learning object-oriented programming (OOP), software design principles, and problem-solving with .NET. Each project demonstrates specific concepts in C#, including classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, file handling, and application structuring.

The goal of this repository is to showcase my progress in C#, build a strong foundation in programming, and provide working examples of practical applications written in C#.

## Projects Included

- **Journal App**  
  A simple journaling program that allows users to record, display, and save entries.  
  *Concepts*: File I/O, data persistence, classes, lists, user input handling.

- **Mindfulness Activities App**  
  A console-based wellness app with breathing, reflection, and listing exercises to guide mindfulness.  
  *Concepts*: Inheritance, polymorphism, randomization, loops, encapsulation.

- **Scripture Memorizer**  
  A tool for memorizing scriptures by gradually hiding words until the passage is remembered.  
  *Concepts*: String manipulation, classes and objects, randomization, encapsulation.

- **Shape Calculator**  
  A program demonstrating polymorphism by calculating areas of different shapes using a common interface.  
  *Concepts*: Abstract classes, inheritance, polymorphism, method overriding.

## Learning Objectives

By working on these projects, I practiced and strengthened the following:

- Writing **clean, modular, and reusable code** using classes and objects.
- Applying **object-oriented programming principles**: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- Understanding **class relationships** and designing maintainable program architectures.
- Using **.NET and C# project structures** with multiple files and namespaces.
- Implementing **file input/output** for data storage and persistence.
- Handling **user input and validation** effectively.
- Using **randomization and loops** to create dynamic user experiences.
- Practicing **problem-solving skills** through practical applications.
- Documenting projects with **README files** for clarity and professionalism.
- Building confidence with **GitHub version control** and organizing repositories.
